🧠 Project Explanation (Simplified for Beginners)
1.	Data Collection:
The project starts with a dataset containing information about OLA rides — including ride IDs, dates, customers, drivers, vehicle types, distances, fares, and payment modes.
2.	Data Analysis using SQL:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to explore and clean the data.
o	Queries are written to calculate:
	Total rides completed
	Average fare per ride
	Rides by city, driver, or payment method
	Top-performing drivers and most loyal customers
	Revenue generated from different payment types
This step helps in understanding the raw data and preparing it for visualization.
3.	Data Visualization using Power BI:
The cleaned and summarized SQL data is imported into Power BI, where an interactive dashboard is created.
The dashboard includes:
o	📊 Ride Volume Trends: Rides per day/week/month
o	👥 Customer Insights: Most frequent and high-spending customers
o	🚗 Driver & Vehicle Performance: Which drivers and vehicle types perform best
o	💳 Payment Analysis: Distribution of payments by cash, card, or wallet
o	💰 Revenue Overview: Total income and comparison by region or category
4.	Insights & Findings:
The visual dashboard allows OLA (or any ride-based business) to quickly:
o	Identify peak ride times
o	Track performance of drivers
o	Analyze customer loyalty and satisfaction patterns
o	Monitor revenue growth and preferred payment modes
